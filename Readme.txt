About Project:------->

Application of Simulation in M/M/1 queueing model in a medical centre. The simulation table provides a systematic method of studying the future behaviour of the system over time. The main aim of this project is to find the waiting time of a patient in
the queue, the waiting time of a patient in the medical centre, the idle time of a doctor, the queue length and also to compare
with the mathematical solution.



Folder Contains:------->
